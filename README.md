# Analysis of Automobilization of Slovakia (2003-2024)

## Goals
- Analyze trends in the number of registered vehicles in Slovakia over the period of 2003-2024
- Identify possible underlying factors that are driving the change

## Key Insights
- Over the period of 2003-2024, the number of registered **passenger cars in Slovakia increased by 152%** (from 1.08 million to 2.72 million).
- On average, the number of registered **passenger cars increased by nearly 78,000 each year**.
- Although the increase in the registered passenger cars was **less dramatic during major crises** (2008 financial crisis, Covid-19, war in Ukraine), **not a single year was marked by an actual decrease**.

## Yearly Change in the Number of Passenger Cars
- The significant difference between years 2004 and 2005 indicates some administrative change in vehicle registration.
- 2009 most likely saw the aftermath of the **2008 financial crisis**.
- A major **decline** is also visible over the **Covid-19 period** (2020-2021) followed by the start of the **war in Ukraine** (2022).

## The Number of Vehicles of Other Categories
- The number of vehicles such as buses, trailers, motorcycles and other small vehicles has been more-or-less stable over the years.
- The number of **freight vehicles a tractors** dropped significantly during the **2008 financial crisis** and has not recovered ever since, with another significant drop in 2019.

## The Number of Passenger Cars by Region
- Interestingly, the only region that was significantly affected by the **Covid-19** crisis in terms of a decrease in the number of passenger cars was the **Bratislava Region**. I see two possible explanations for this:
  - The Bratislava Region is highly urbanized, and thus accommodates many companies that own passenger cars. Theese cars might have become redundant, because of the lockdowns in 2021.
  - The Bratislava Region also accommodates a large portion of population from other regions of Slovakia who regularly travel home on weekends. With lockdowns and home office, the need for such travels might have significantly decreased.

## The Number of Passenger Cars per 100 Inhabitants by District (2003)
- As off **2003**, we can see that the Bratislava District dominates in terms of the number of passenger cars per 100 inhabitants
  - The **Bratislava** District: **36 cars / 100 people**
  - The rest of **Slovakia** (average): **18 cars / 100 people**

## The Number of Passenger Cars per 100 Inhabitants by District (2024)
- 21 years later in **2024**, the trend remains, with the Bratislava leading sifnicantly and the rest of Slovakia falling about 15 years behind the trend
  - The **Bratislava** District: **76 cars / 100 people**
  - The rest of **Slovakia** (average): **47 cars / 100 people**
- Moreover, the growing level of automobilization seems to spreading from the west to the east.

## Change in the Number of Passenger Cars per 1000 Inhabitants by District (2022-2024)
- In the recent years, the most significant increases in the number passenger cars have concentrated in the **neighbouring districts of Bratislava**:
  - Senica District
  - Malacky District
  - Pezinok District
  - Senec District
  - Dunajsk√° Streda District
- An interesting phenomenon of increases in the number of passenger cars can be observed in **the east of Slovakia**, namely in the Sobrance District and to a lesser extent in the Michalovce District. My guess is that it might have to do with cars beingexported to Ukraine.l It has been a common practice for many Ukrainians to buy a car in a European country.
