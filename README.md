# Analysis of Automobilization of Slovakia (2003-2024)

## Goals
- Analyze trends in the number of registered vehicles in Slovakia over the period of 2003-2024
- Identify possible underlying factors that are driving the change

## Key Insights
- Over the period of 2003-2024, the number of registered passenger cars in Slovakia increased by 152% (from 1.08 million to 2.72 million)
- On average, the number of registered passenger cars increased by nearly 78,000 each year
- Although the increase in the registered passenger cars was less dramatic during major crises (2008 financial crisis, Covid-19, war in Ukraine), not in a single year was there an actual decrease in the number of registered cars

- The significant difference between years 2004 and 2005 indicates some administrative change in vehicle registration
- 2009 most likely saw the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis
- A major decline is also visible over the Covid-19 period (2020-2021) followed by the start of the war in Ukraine (2022)
