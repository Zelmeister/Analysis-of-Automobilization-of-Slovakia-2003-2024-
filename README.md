# Analysis of Automobilization of Slovakia (2003-2024)

## Goals
- Analyze trends in the number of registered vehicles in Slovakia over the period of 2003-2024
- Identify possible underlying factors that are driving the change

## Key Insights
- Over the period of 2003-2024, the number of registered **passenger cars in Slovakia increased by 152%** (from 1.08 million to 2.72 million).
- On average, the number of registered **passenger cars increased by nearly 78,000 each year**.
- Although the increase in the registered passenger cars was **less dramatic during major crises** (2008 financial crisis, Covid-19, war in Ukraine), **not a single year was marked by an actual decrease**.
- **Automatization of Slovakia spreads from west to east**, with the Bratislava District (76 cars / 100 people) being about 15 years ahead of the rest of Slovakia (47 cars / 100 people).
- A single **most significant factor** driving the trend seems to be the **disposable income**; however, household size, unemployment rate and percentage of urban population are also correlated with the number of passenger cars.

## Total Number of Passenger Cars

## Yearly Change in the Number of Passenger Cars
- The significant difference between years 2004 and 2005 indicates some administrative change in vehicle registration.
- 2009 most likely saw the aftermath of the **2008 financial crisis**.
- A major **decline** is also visible over the **Covid-19 period** (2020-2021), followed by the start of the **war in Ukraine** (2022).

## The Number of Vehicles of Other Categories
- The number of vehicles such as **buses, trailers, motorcycles and other small vehicles** has been more-or-less **stable** over the years.
- The number of **freight vehicles and tractors** dropped significantly during the **2008 financial crisis**, and has not recovered ever since, with another significant drop in 2019.

## The Number of Passenger Cars by Region
- Interestingly, the **only region that was significantly affected by the Covid-19** crisis in terms of a decrease in the number of passenger cars was the **Bratislava Region**. I see two possible explanations for this:
  - The Bratislava Region is highly urbanized, and thus accommodates many companies that own passenger cars. Theese cars might have become redundant, because of the lockdowns in 2021.
  - The Bratislava Region also accommodates a large portion of population from other regions of Slovakia, who regularly travel home on weekends. With lockdowns and home office, the need for such travels might have significantly decreased.

## The Number of Passenger Cars per 100 Inhabitants by District (2003)
- As off **2003**, we can see that the Bratislava District dominates in terms of the number of passenger cars per 100 inhabitants
  - The **Bratislava** District: **36 cars / 100 people**
  - The rest of **Slovakia** (average): **18 cars / 100 people**

## The Number of Passenger Cars per 100 Inhabitants by District (2024)
- 21 years later in **2024**, the trend remains, with the Bratislava Distrtict leading sifnicantly and the rest of Slovakia falling about 15 years behind the trend
  - The **Bratislava** District: **76 cars / 100 people**
  - The rest of **Slovakia** (average): **47 cars / 100 people**
- Moreover, the growing level of automobilization seems to spreading from the west to the east.

## Change in the Number of Passenger Cars per 1000 Inhabitants by District (2022-2024)
- In the recent years, the most significant increases in the number passenger cars have concentrated in the **neighbouring districts of Bratislava**:
  - Senica District
  - Malacky District
  - Pezinok District
  - Senec District
  - Dunajská Streda District
- An interesting phenomenon of increases in the number of passenger cars can be observed in **the east of Slovakia**, namely in the Sobrance District and to a lesser extent in the Michalovce District. My guess is that it might have to do with cars being exported to Ukraine. It has been a common practice for many Ukrainians to buy cars in European countries.

## Passenger Cars per 100 inhabitants vs Disposable Income
- There seems to be a **direct link between** the number of passenger **cars** per 100 inhabitants of a region and the region's average **disposable income** per person.

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

## Passenger Cars per 100 inhabitants vs Unemployment Rate
- Ditricts with **higher unemployment** rates tend to have **less cars** per 100 people, although the impact of unemployment seems to be more significant now (2024) than in the past (2003).
- In 2003, unemployement does not seem to have been a major factor affecting the number of cars per 100 inhabitants of a district.

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

## Passenger Cars per 100 inhabitants vs Household Size
- The hypothesis was that the more people in a household, the higher the need for car.
- However, in Slovakia this seems to be the contrary – **the greater the average household size of a region, the smaller number of passenger cars per 100 inhabitants**.
- My guess is that this is because the average household size goes hand in hand with income.
- In Slovakia, regions with **socially excluded communities** with low income tend to be the ones, in which one household accommodates more people than elsewhere.

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

## Passenger Cars per 100 inhabitants vs Urban population
- A **slight positive link** can be observed **between** the portion of district's **population living in urban areas and** the number of **cars per 100 people**
- The expection was that rural regions might have a greater need for cars in order to be able to travel to cities. However, again the contrary is true.
- This is probably due to **more companies** that being **concentrated in urban areas**. Not only do these companies bring in employment and income, they also tend to own cars themselves.
