# Analysis of Automobilization of Slovakia (2003-2024)

## Goals
- Analyze trends in the number of registered vehicles in Slovakia over the period of 2003-2024
- Identify possible underlying factors that are driving the change

## Key Insights
- Over the period of 2003-2024, the number of registered passenger cars in Slovakia increased by 152% (from 1.08 million to 2.72 million).
- On average, the number of registered passenger cars increased by nearly 78,000 each year.
- Although the increase in the registered passenger cars was less dramatic during major crises (2008 financial crisis, Covid-19, war in Ukraine), not a single year was marked by an actual decrease.

- The significant difference between years 2004 and 2005 indicates some administrative change in vehicle registration.
- 2009 most likely saw the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis.
- A major decline is also visible over the Covid-19 period (2020-2021) followed by the start of the war in Ukraine (2022).

- The number of vehicles such as buses, trailers, motorcycles and other small vehicles has been more-or-less stable over the years.
- The number of freight vehicles a tractors dropped significantly during the 2008 financial crisis and has not recovered ever since, with another significant drop in 2019.

- Interestingly, the only region that was significantly affected by the Covid-19 crisis in terms of a decrease in the number of passenger cars was the Bratislava Region. I see two possible explanations for this:
  - The Bratislava Region is highly urbanized, and thus accommodates many companies that own passenger cars. Theese cars might have become redundant, because of the lockdowns in 2021.
  - The Bratislava Region also accommodates a large portion of population from other regions of Slovakia who regularly travel home on weekends. With lockdowns and home-office, the need for such travels might have significantly decreased.
