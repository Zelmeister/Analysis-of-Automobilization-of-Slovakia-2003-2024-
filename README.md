# Custom-Project-Automobilization-of-Slovakia
This is a project done using the Python script. It is an analysis of the level of automobilization of Slovakia from 2003 to 2024. Apart from general statistics about the number of passenger cars in Slovakia, the analysis also focuses on a number of possible underlying socio-economic factors contributing to the rapid increase in the number of cars. 

"Custom_Project_Automobilization_of_SR.ipynb" is the main file containing the script. 

The rest of the files are either inputs or outputs of the main file.  Important note: There are two interractive maps of Slovakia. To be able to view them, I recommend to use the Dash library within Jupyter Notebook.
